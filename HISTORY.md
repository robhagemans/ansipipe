ANSI|pipe code history
======================
https://github.com/robhagemans/ansipipe

ANSI|pipe is derived from the following sources:

- Win32::Console::ANSI Perl extension by J-L Morel
- dualsubsystem by gaber...@gmail.com, based on work by Richard Eperjesi
- further additions and modifications by Rob Hagemans


dualsubsystem
=============
https://code.google.com/p/dualsubsystem/

Modifications to dualsysystem code:  

(RH 2015-01-28)

-   Change whitespace and naming conventions for readability
-   Replace command-line parsing code
-   Implement Unicode support, UTF8 conversions
-   Send stdout pipe output to ansi parser


Win32::Console::ANSI
====================
http://www.bribes.org/perl/wANSIConsole.html

Modifications to Win32::Console::ANSI code:  

(RH 2015-01-27)

-   Remove DLL injection and API hooking code
-   Remove Win9x support code
-   Add #define macros to allow compilation under MinGW GCC  

(RH 2015-01-28)

-   Change signature of ParseAndPrint to work with one hDev only
-   Remove codepage-conversion sequences ('\x1b(')  

(RH 2015-01-30)

-   Add escape sequences for scrolling, terminal resizing, xterm bright colours
-   Add ANSI input routine (sends sequences for special keys)
-   Refactor code to allow multiple parsers (for cerr and cout)  

In other words, I have extracted only the escape sequence parser from the
original source and then modified that.

The original code was released under PERL's licensing terms.
The author, J-L Morel, has kindly relicensed his code under an MIT-style licence upon my request.
I reproduce his message here (original addresses removed):

    Hi Rob,

    There is no problem.

    I give you permission to use the code of Win32::Console::ANSI under the
    open-source license of your choice.

    I am happy if my code can be reused in other projects : this is proof
    that it is not so bad ;-)

    Have a nice day.
